# 30 Days GANs Paper Reading
Follow me on linkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-gautam/

I intend to go through the basic GAN paper, learning the fundamental principles, and then go on to some of the more recent gans and related concepts. I plan to provide annotation document as well as a synopsis of each article I read and scratch implementation of each paper (if possible). 

Your thoughts and comments are really valuable, making this challenge a terrific resource for everyone. I'll be putting everything on this github repo.
